Get a mixing bowl
Put in two cups of self-raising flour 
If you only have regular flour, add a teaspoon of baking powder to it
Then add a cup of sugar (without the moths)
Add a cup of milk
Half a cup of oil
Two eggs
And one tablespoon of vanilla extract!
Mix the recipe so far together.
If you want to be fast, you can get a mini donut maker which will make the donuts in 3 minutes
Otherwise get an oven tray with donut shapes, and put it in the oven, which will last 8-9 minutes.
Spray it
Pour the mixture straight in
Take them out once they're made, let them cool, and then make the yummy strawberry glaze!
Get a bowl, and put one cup of icing sugar, and sift it.
Add two tablespoons of milk
And half a teaspoon of strawberry extract
If you want more colour, add some drops of red food colouring.
Then just mix it together until the mixture is nice and red
Get your donuts, dip them in.
If you want, you can put sprinkles in them. Otherwise you're done!
Okay Kavya ma'am, now you can make the donuts, don't forget to get the ingredients!
